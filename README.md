# Campus Smoking/Vaping Detection Pipeline

Goal: Offline batch pipeline to detect students smoking or vaping using face detection (RetinaFace), face recognition (ArcFace embeddings), and smoking activity classification (image + later temporal).

Components:
- Face Detection: RetinaFace (InsightFace)
- Face Recognition: ArcFace embeddings with cosine similarity
- Smoking Detection: Stage 1 image classifier, Stage 2 optional object detector (cigarette/vape), Stage 3 SlowFast (temporal)
